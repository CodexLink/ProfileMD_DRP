                        (2) Await the first super().__ainit__() which instantiates ArgumentResolver, this is required before we do tasking since we need to evaluate the given arguments.
                        (3.a) Instantiate the super().__init__(intents) which belongs to DiscordClientHandler. This is required to load other properties that is required by its methods.
                        (3.b) We cannot await this one because discord.__init__ is not a coroutine. And it shouldn't be, which is right.
