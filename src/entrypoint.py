				(1.b) We migh want to shield this async function to avoid corruption. We don't want a malformed output.
				(2) Await the first super().__ainit__() which instantiates ArgumentResolver, this is required before we do tasking since we need to evaluate the given arguments.
				(3.a) Instantiate the super().__init__(intents) which belongs to DiscordClientHandler. This is required to load other properties that is required by its methods.
				(3.b) We cannot await this one because discord.__init__ is not a coroutine. And it shouldn't be, which is right.
