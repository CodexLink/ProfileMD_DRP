                (1.a) Let's load the logger first to enable backtracking incase if there's anything happened wrong. [If explicitly stated to run based on arguments.]
                (1.b) We migh want to shield this async function to avoid corruption. We don't want a malformed output.
                (2) Await the first super().__ainit__() which instantiates ArgumentResolver, this is required before we do tasking since we need to evaluate the given arguments.
                (3.a) Instantiate the super().__init__(intents) which belongs to DiscordClientHandler. This is required to load other properties that is required by its methods.
                (3.b) We cannot await this one because discord.__init__ is not a coroutine. And it shouldn't be, which is right.
                (4) And once we load the properties, we can now asynchronously load discord in task. Do not await this task!
                (5) There will be another task that is gathered into one so that it is distinguishly different than other await functions. They are quite important under same context.
