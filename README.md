## Welcome

Hello! This repository is still under construction and work in progress. Progression is approximated to be 70%.

An overdetailed-async implementation........ [???]

## What's missing?

To give you an overview, here is the list that contain implementations and tasks that I haven't started yet.

- Badge Constructor and Validator
- Arguments (Both Optional and Required)
- README Modifier
- Git Commit and Push as User

> The list will be updated as I push possible changes.

TL;DR: Semi-usable but cannot be used **as-is** due to components missing.

## Usage

...

## Workflow

The following `YAML` workflow is a bare-minimum that you may need to paste on your profile's repo located in `.github/actions` .

``` yaml
name: Discord Rich Presence Activity Badge
on:
  schedule:

    - cron: "30 0-23 * * *" # Customizable 15 Minutes Less Not Allowed!, At minute 30 past every hour from 0 through 23.

  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  BadgeUpdater:
    name: Discord Activity Watcher
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Update README Discord Badge to Latest Upstream
      - uses: CodexLink/discord-rich-presence-activity-badge@main

        with:
          DISCORD_USER_ID: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_USER_ID }}
          DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN }}
          WORKFLOW_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          IS_DRY_RUN: true

```

> This workflow will run once it has been dispatched (manually) or is on scheduled to run for every **30 minutes per hour** to check for the user's status.

## Parameters

The following sub-sections contain a set of possible inputs that you can integrate with this workflow. These sub-sections contain elements that is subjected to change. It is not yet finalized because there are a variety of configurations that I want to include and I'm not sure if that would be useful.

### Required

These inputs are required in order to run the Docker Container.

| `DISCORD_USERNAME` | The user's discord username. Required as a target for the rich presence status lookup.    |

> Having of one them not included in your secrets will result in an error. If possible, the bot will send you a message about it in Discord.
