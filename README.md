## Usage

**The script is not yet finished! (around 90% is done) This is just a notice!!!**

### Workflow

Paste the following `YAML` on profile repository under directory `.github/workflows`.

``` yaml
name: Discord Rich Presence Activity Badge

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "30 0-23 * * *" # This is customizable, At minute 30 past every hour from 0 through 23.

  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  BadgeUpdater:
    name: Static Badge Updater
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Update README Discord Badge to Latest Upstream
      - uses: CodexLink/discord-activity-badge@main

        with:
          DISCORD_USER_ID: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_USER_ID }}
          DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN }}

```

> This workflow will run once it has been dispatched (manually) or is on scheduled to run for every **30 minutes per hour** to check for the user's status.

### Constraints

The following sub-topics pinpoints some things to consider before attempting to use this script.

### Rate Limits

As this script performs changes to the badge by static, we know that we might potentially abuse the API. We need to know some limitations and conclude the best minimum time update so that we won't get flagged.

As I further check some limitations from any of the APIs, here are the following restrictions upon request.

- 5000 Requests per hour (Github API).
- 50 Requests per Second (Discord API).

> There are no rate-limitations declared in badgen.net so far. Will further investigate.

### Method

This method (describes the script) shows the very cheap way to bridge our Discord to Github. There are many other ways that can made this quite easier but I don't want to spend some money (if I have a money). Plus, this is a pet project with the practice of committing to the development + practice of design patterns and formality (even when I'm alone).

## Parameters

The following sub-sections contain a set of possible inputs that you can integrate with this workflow. These sub-sections contain elements that is subjected to change. It is not yet finalized because there are a variety of configurations that I want to include and I'm not sure if that would be useful.

### Required (In-Need-of-Evaluation) Parameters

These inputs are required in order to run the Docker Container.

| Inputs   | Type + Defaults | Description                            |
| -------- | :---------------| -------------------------------------- |
| `COMMIT_MESSAGE` | `str`: Discord Activity Badge Updated as of `datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%m/%d/%y â€” %I:%M:%S %p")` ***See constants.py:79 (_eval_date_on_exec)*** | The commit message that will be invoked in the commit when there's changes to push.
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | `str` (**Required**) | The token of your bot from the Discord's Developer Page. Note that, you have to use your own bot! Go check [Discord Developers](https://discord.com/developers/). |
| `DISCORD_USER_ID` | `int` (Required) | An integer ID used to identify you in Discord. This does not associate your name and discriminator, so you are fine. |
| `PROFILE_REPOSITORY` | `str`: `GITHUB_ACTOR/GITHUB_ACTOR` | The repository from where the commits will be pushed. Fill this up  when you are indirectly deploying the script under different repository. |
| `WORKFLOW_TOKEN` | `str` (**Required**) | The token of the Github Workflow Instance used to authenticate commits deployed by the script. Fill this up if you want to test locally so that you aren't going to be rate limited. |
| `BADGE_IDENTIFIER_NAME` | `str`: Discord Activity Badge | The name of the badge (in markdown form) that will be utilized to replace the badge state's contents. If the identifier does not exists, it will proceed to create a new one and append it on the top of your README. **You must arranged it right after.** |

> Having of one the requirements left out will result in an error. If possible, the bot will send you a message about it in Discord.

### Optional Parameters

These inputs are optional and has the capability to override the display of the badge and the commit message. To make ease with the usage of these optional inputs, please check the results of the table row for each command.

#### Extensibility and Customization

| Input         | Description + Result |
| :-----------: | :------------------: |
| `str` `ACTIVITY_[CUSTOM/RICH_PRESENCE/GAME/STREAM]_COLOR` *Note*:***HEX RGB only*** | Renders status badge color whenever there's a certain activity. Which renders user's state color in subject if certain activity has color specified. Leaving these setting by default (None) will result to render user's state color. **See example of `APPEND_STATE_ON_SUBJECT`**. That should ignore `SHIFT_STATE_ACTIVITY_COLOR` if that is the case. [![Demo #7](https://badgen.net/badge/Currently%20Streaming/Visual%20Studio%20Code/purple?icon=discord&labelColor=green)](https://github.com/CodexLink/discord-activity-badge)
| `bool` `APPEND_DETAIL_PRESENCE` *Defaults to*: **False** | (**_Rich Presence Only!_**) Appends `detail` field to the Status Badge alongside with the application name. [![Demo #5](https://badgen.net/badge/Discord%20Activity/Playing%20Visual%20Studio%20Code,%20Editing%20entrypoint.py:159/green?icon=discord)](https://github.com/CodexLink/discord-activity-badge)
| `bool` `APPEND_STATE_ON_SUBJECT` *Defaults to*: **False** | Overrides `Discord Activity` (Subject String) **and** User State with the state of `Playing`, `Watching`, `Listening`, this avoids making the status longer and balanced. If this is a `CustomActivity`, it will append User's State **[Online, Idle, DND, Offline]** instead.[![Demo #7](https://badgen.net/badge/Currently%20Playing/Visual%20Studio%20Code/green?icon=discord)](https://github.com/CodexLink/discord-activity-badge/)
| `str` `PREFERRED_ACTIVITY` *Options*: *[GAME, **RICH_PRESENCE**, STREAM]* | Renders a particular activity as a prioritized activity. If the preferred activity does not exist, it will render any activity by default. **There will be no demo since it only choose what activity should be displayed.** |
| `bool` `SHIFT_STATE_ACTIVITY_COLORS` *Defaults to*: **False** | Interchange state and activity colors. This is useful only if you want to retain your state color position even though `APPEND_STATE_ON_SUBJECT` is true. [![Example #8](https://badgen.net/badge/Currently%20Streaming/Visual%20Studio%20Code/green?icon=discord&labelColor=purple)](https://github.com/CodexLink/discord-activity-badge) |
| `str` `SHOW_TIME_DURATION` *Options: *[**HOUR**, HOUR+MINUTES]* | Appends time after the application name or detail when `APPEND_DETAIL_PRESENCE` is **True**. [![Demo #8](https://badgen.net/badge/Currently%20Playing/Visual%20Studio%20Code,%206%20hours%20Elapsed./green?icon=discord)](https://github.com/CodexLink/discord-activity-badge) |
| `str` `TIME_ELAPSED_OVERRIDE_STRING` *Defaults to*: **elapsed.** | Overrides the string appended whenever the time is displayed for elapsed. This is effective only when SHOW_TIME_DURATION is **True**. [![Demo #9](https://badgen.net/badge/Currently%20Playing/Visual%20Studio%20Code,%206%20hours%20and%20counting./green?icon=discord)](https://github.com/CodexLink/discord-activity-badge) |
| `str` `TIME_REMAINING_OVERRIDE_STRING` *Defaults to*: **remaining.** | Overrides the string appended whenever the time is displayed for remaining. This is effective only when SHOW_TIME_DURATION is **True**. [![Demo #10](https://badgen.net/badge/Currently%20Playing/Visual%20Studio%20Code,%206%20hours%209%20minutes%20to%20finish./green?icon=discord)](https://github.com/CodexLink/discord-activity-badge) |

**You got some ideas or did I miss something out? Please generate an issue or PR (if you have declared it on your own), and we will talk about it.**
